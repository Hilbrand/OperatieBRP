Welcome to JBossESB. Within this directory and its sub-directories you will find documentation on JBossESB as well as some background concepts around Service Oriented Architecture principles and where an ESB should fit. However, because there is a lot of documentation, we have provided this README to help you decide where to start.

If this is your first encounter with JBossESB (or ESBs in general), then we recommend the following route through our documentation:

(i) Start with the Getting Started Guide, as this will give you an overview of what's available within JBossESB and how to get going quickly.

(ii) Move on to the Samples sub-directory, which will give you an overview of the trailblazer. Take a look at the various Quickstarts as well.

(iii) For an overview of SOA concepts, there's an appendix in the Programmers Guide.

(iv) When you are ready, move on to the same sequence of documents as veteran JBossESB developers.


If you are a veteran of JBossESB, or ESBs in general veteran, then we recommend:

(i) Check the ReleaseNotes to see what's different between this release and the previous one.

(ii) Go through the Administration Guide to ensure that your installation is appropriately configured and you are confident about managing it. This includes a Management and Monitoring section that describes the types of metrics you can gain access to when running your ESB application.

(iii) Next move on to the Programmers Guide, which will give you an in depth description of JBossESB components and services.

(iv) Read through the MessageAction part of the Programmers Guide to familiarize yourself with the out-of-the-box Actions. You may find them useful when developing new applications.

(v) Look at the Adapters section of the Programmers Guide: not everything you will be integrating with JBossESB will be able to understand the native protocols it uses.
