Overview:
=========
 This quickstart demonstrates JBossESB ability to process large files.

 The quickstart works as follows:
 1.  There are 2 Services:
     a) Splitter Service
     b) Receiver Service
 2.  The Splitter Service picks up an XML order message via the File Gateway (<fs-listener>).
     The <fs-listener> is configured with the FileStreamSplitter, which applies a Smooks
     message splitting process (defined in smooks-config.xml).  This process splits the
     XML message, routing XML message fragments to the Receiver Service.
 3.  The Smooks splitting process works by streaming the XML message and while doing so:
     a) Extracts data from the order header details and places it in a "header" bean.
     b) Extracts data from the order item and places it in a "orderItem" bean.  It only
        ever has the details of a single order item in memory at any given time.  This
        is what allows it to process a huge message stream.
     c) As it passes each order item, applys a FreeMarker template to the data in the bean
        context ("header" and "orderItem) to generate the split fragment for the order item.
     d) As it passes each order item, routes the generated split fragment for that order item,
        as generated by the FreeMarker template, to the Receiver Service.

Note here that the split fragments being generated and routed to the Receiver Service are not
just dumb block copies of fragments from the source message.  They are formatted differently
and contain data not just from the individual order item, but also from the order header.

Running this quickstart:
========================
  Please refer to 'ant help-quickstarts' for prerequisites about the quickstarts
  and a more detailed descripton of the different ways to run the quickstarts.

  Make sure that the quickstarts.properties file contains the configuration
  information for the FTP hostname, user, password and base directory.

  Make sure that you have write access to the FTP server.

To Run:
===========================
  1. 'ant deploy'
  2. 'ant runtest' 	- you will be asked how many order-items that the sample SampleOrder.xml should contain.
  3. Switch to the Application Server console to see the output from the ESB.  Here you will see
     each of the split message fragments as received by the "Receiver" service.
  4. In this folder ("Window1"), type 'ant undeploy'.

 File sizes:
	When generating the SampleOrder.xml the following nr of order-items can be entered(
	really any number can be entered but this is to give an idea of the how many rows 
	create a file or a certain size) :
	order-items						Size
	50000							4 MB
	100000							9 MB
	1000000							91 MB
	7000000							646 MB							
	10000000						924 MB
	25000000						2325 MB		
	40000000						3727 MB
