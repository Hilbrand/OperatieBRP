        <title>JBossESB - MTOM/XOP Quickstart</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        This sample demonstrates how to exchange binary data between a Webservice client and ESB aware
        Webservice Service, using MTOM/XOP.  JBossESB relies of JBossWS for MTOM/XOP support.
        <a href="http://jbws.dyndns.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_Guide#MTOM.2FXOP">See more here</a>.
        <p/>
        This quickstart simply sends an image (binary data) from a webservice client to a JBossESB aware
        Webservice, using MTOM/XOP.

        <h2>Prerequisits</h2>
        Please refer to 'ant help-quickstarts' for prerequisites about the quickstarts
        and a more detailed descripton of the different ways to run the quickstarts.
        <p/>
        <b style="text-decoration:  blink; color: red">NOTE:</b> This Quickstart requires the JBossRemoting 2.2.2SP2 or higher patch to be applied.
        If you are running on the JBoss App Server (and not the JBoss ESB Server), then you may need to apply a patch.  This simply involves downloading
        <a href="http://repository.jboss.org/jboss/remoting/2.2.2.SP2/lib/jboss-remoting.jar">jboss-remoting.jar</a>
        and copying it into your "server/&lt;server&gt;/lib" folder.  Be sure to restart your JBoss
        Application/ESB Server instance.

        <h2>To Run</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a command terminal window in this folder ("Window1"), type 'ant deploy'.</li>
            <li>Open another command terminal window in this folder ("Window2"), type
                'ant runtest'.
            </li>
            <li>Check "Window1" and "Window2" for output.</li>
            <li>To undeploy, type 'ant undeploy' in "Window1".</li>
        </ol>

        "Window1" should contain ESB Server side logging from the quickstart, showing the message before and
        after execution through the SOAPProcessor.

        <p/>
        "Window2" should contain Client side logging from the quickstart, showing the the image (binary data)
        was successfully transmitted from client to server and back.  See
