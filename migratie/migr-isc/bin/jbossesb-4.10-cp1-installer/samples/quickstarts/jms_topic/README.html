    </head>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        This sample demonstrates how to configure a pair of Services to receive a message
        from the same JMS Topic via configurations of the &lt;jms-listener&gt; as a
        "topic" based gateway.
        <p/>
        This quickstart simply sends a message to a JMS topic, on which service "MyService1"
        and "MyService2" are listening.  Both of these services then send a message to
        "MyService3".
<pre>
                            - -> MyService1 -> - |
                            |                    |
   -> - "quickstart-topic" -|                    |- - - MyService3
                            |                    |
                            - -> MyService2 -> - |
</pre>

        <h2>Prerequisits</h2>
        Please refer to 'ant help-quickstarts' for prerequisites about the quickstarts
        and a more detailed descripton of the different ways to run the quickstarts.

        <h2>To Run</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a command terminal window in this folder ("Window1"), type 'ant deploy'.</li>
            <li>Open another command terminal window in this folder ("Window2"), type
                'ant runtest'.
            </li>
            <li>Check "Window1" and "Window2" for output.</li>
            <li>To undeploy, type 'ant undeploy' in "Window1".</li>
        </ol>

        "Window1" should contain ESB Server side logging from the quickstart.  The last 4 logs are the
        logs of interest, showing the message being "processed" by MyService1 and MyService2, which forward
        the messages on to MyService3.
