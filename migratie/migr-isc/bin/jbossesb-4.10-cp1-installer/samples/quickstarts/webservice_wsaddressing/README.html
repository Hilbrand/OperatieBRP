        <title>JBossESB - WS-Addressing Quickstart</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        This sample demonstrates how to implement a stateful webservice using WS-Addressing and access it through
        an ESB endpoint.  JBossESB relies of JBossWS for WS-Addressing support.
        <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossws/docs/jaxws_userguide-2.0/index.html#d0e882">See more here</a>.
        <p/>
        The sample is a really simple standalone shopping cart.  The webservice client class uses JAX-WS client
        code and creates 2 client port instances to perform add, get and checkout operations on the sample
        cart.
        <p/>
        As an excercise, you could attempt to implement the cart functionality as a Stateful Session Bean that gets
        invoked via this webservice interface.  This would mimic the usecase where the cart is a legacy service
        implemented in EJB and you're using the ESB to expose a Webservice interface on that service.

        <h2>Prerequisits</h2>
        Please refer to 'ant help-quickstarts' for prerequisites about the quickstarts
        and a more detailed descripton of the different ways to run the quickstarts.
        <p/>
        <b style="text-decoration:  blink; color: red">NOTE:</b> This Quickstart requires the JBossRemoting 2.2.2SP2 or higher patch to be applied.
        This simply involves downloading <a href="http://repository.jboss.org/jboss/remoting/2.2.2.SP2/lib/jboss-remoting.jar">jboss-remoting.jar</a>
        and copying it into your "server/&lt;server&gt;/lib" folder.  Be sure to restart your JBoss
        Application/ESB Server instance.

        <h2>To Run</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a command terminal window in this folder ("Window1"), type 'ant deploy'.</li>
            <li>Open another command terminal window in this folder ("Window2"), type
                'ant runtest'.
            </li>
            <li>Check "Window1" and "Window2" for output.</li>
            <li>To undeploy, type 'ant undeploy' in "Window1".</li>
        </ol>

        "Window1" should contain ESB Server side logging from the quickstart, showing the message before and
        after execution through the SOAPProcessor.

        <p/>
        "Window2" should contain Client side logging from the quickstart, showing the view of the shopping
        carts for both client port instances as the cart transitions through its different states. See
