It's technically not a true suffix. It's a combination of two suffixes and the last part of certain words.

The two suffixes in question are, '-ate' and '-or'.

The suffix '-ate' as used in this instance is to show that the word is being acted out by turning it into a verb. For example, to create a replica, you replicate.

(There are other words such as 'eliminate' or 'terminate' which don't necessarily have an English root noun, as the word was created from the roots of other languages, such as Greek or Latin.
You can retroactively create a noun from these verbs by adding '-ion/-tion' if the original root doesn't already constitute a noun. For example, you illustrate an illustration.)

The suffix '-or/-er' in this instance is added to verbs to show a doer of the verb. For example, something that paints is a painter. Something that acts is an actor.

So finally, you get to words that happen to end with an '-in' or an '-ine'. These are words such as 'vaccine' or 'chlorine'. So to apply chlorine or a vaccine, you chlorinate and vaccinate. The subject who applies these things is a chlorinator or a vaccinator.

Basically, the '-inator' joke indicates that the object in question is something that does an action.
